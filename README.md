# MessageInjector
The Message Inject is able to inject AVRO and XML bases massages into the DRIVER+ testbed. It provides also a
REST Endpoint to allow other Testbed applications to inject also messages into the testbed. XML messages will be
validated against the based schema and translatet to the corresponding AVRO message for distribution.
